# BGP Mesh Network Troubleshooting and Repair Summary

## Project Overview

This project involved diagnosing and fixing critical issues in a BGP mesh network infrastructure deployed on Vultr cloud platform. The network consists of 4 nodes in different geographic locations running BIRD routing daemon with WireGuard VPN mesh connectivity.

## Network Architecture

- **ASN**: 27218 (Infinitum Nihil, Inc)
- **IPv4 Range**: 192.30.120.0/23
- **IPv6 Range**: 2620:71:4000::/48
- **Anycast IPs**: 
  - IPv4: 192.30.120.10/32
  - IPv6: 2620:71:4000::c01e:780a/128

### Node Configuration
- **LAX (Primary)**: 149.248.2.74 (WG: 10.10.10.1) - Route Reflector
- **ORD (Secondary)**: 66.42.113.101 (WG: 10.10.10.2) - Client
- **MIA (Tertiary)**: 149.28.108.180 (WG: 10.10.10.3) - Client  
- **EWR (Quaternary)**: 66.135.18.138 (WG: 10.10.10.4) - Client

## Initial State & Problems Identified

### Starting Condition
When the troubleshooting session began, the system had:
- Partial BGP mesh connectivity
- A PHP-based looking glass displaying only "BIRD 2.17.1 ready"
- IPv6 BGP configuration issues
- WireGuard connectivity problems
- BGP hold timer expiration issues

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Looking Glass Malfunction**: BGP routes query returned only "BIRD 2.17.1 ready" instead of actual routing information
2. **WireGuard Configuration Issues**: Duplicate peer entries causing routing conflicts
3. **BGP Hold Timer Problems**: Default timers too aggressive for WireGuard tunnel latency
4. **IPv6 Static Protocol Down**: Anycast IPv6 protocol not functioning
5. **Node Connectivity Issues**: ORD and EWR nodes becoming unresponsive
6. **Company Designation Error**: Displayed as "LLC" instead of "Inc"

## Work Performed

### 1. Looking Glass Debugging & Repair
**Problem**: Looking glass BGP routes only showed "BIRD 2.17.1 ready"
**Solution**: 
- Identified incorrect BGP query syntax in PHP code
- Changed from `'show route where proto ~ "bgp*"'` to `'show route where source = RTS_BGP'`
- Updated company designation from "LLC" to "Inc"
- Deployed fixed looking glass to production

**File Modified**: `/home/normtodd/birdbgp/working-lg.php`

### 2. WireGuard Mesh Network Cleanup
**Problem**: Duplicate WireGuard peer entries causing routing conflicts
**Analysis**: Found 5 peers on LAX when only 3 expected (ORD, MIA, EWR):
- 2 peers had no `AllowedIPs` configured
- Duplicate endpoints for same servers with different public keys
- High latency (9-10 seconds) indicating routing issues

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate peer entries with missing `AllowedIPs`
- Cleaned up WireGuard configuration to only include valid peers
- Restarted WireGuard service
- Achieved latency improvement from 9-10s to ~60-70ms

### 3. BGP Hold Timer Optimization
**Problem**: BGP sessions failing with "Hold timer expired" due to WireGuard latency
**Solution**:
- Updated BGP configuration templates in `bgp_config.json`
- Increased hold time from default (~90s) to 240 seconds
- Set keepalive time to 80 seconds
- Applied to both route reflector and client templates

**Files Modified**: 
- `/home/normtodd/birdbgp/bgp_config.json`
- Generated configs in `/home/normtodd/birdbgp/generated_configs/`

### 4. IPv6 Anycast Configuration Fix
**Problem**: `static_anycast_v6` protocol showing "down" status
**Root Cause**: Incorrect IPv6 anycast address configured as `2620:71:4000::10/128`
**Solution**:
- Corrected IPv6 anycast address to `2620:71:4000::c01e:780a/128`
- Protocol status changed from "down" to "up"

### 5. Node Recovery Operations
**Problem**: ORD and EWR nodes became unresponsive to SSH
**Solution**:
- Used Vultr API to restart unresponsive instances
- Identified instance IDs via API calls
- Successfully restarted EWR (66.135.18.138)
- ORD (66.42.113.101) still requires attention

### 6. Network Validation & Testing
**Achievements**:
- MIA iBGP session: ‚úÖ Established
- EWR iBGP session: ‚úÖ Established (after restart and config update)
- IPv6 BGP sessions: ‚úÖ Working
- WireGuard connectivity: ‚úÖ Restored with proper latency
- Looking glass functionality: ‚úÖ Fully operational

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- **LAX Node**: Fully operational as route reflector
- **MIA Node**: iBGP established, full connectivity
- **EWR Node**: Recently recovered, iBGP established
- **Looking Glass**: Displaying proper BGP routing information
- **IPv6 BGP**: All sessions operational
- **WireGuard Mesh**: Clean configuration, proper latencies
- **Anycast Configuration**: Both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols up

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues
- **ORD Node**: Still unresponsive after Vultr API restart attempts
- **BGP Session Count**: Only 2 of 3 iBGP client sessions active due to ORD

### üîß Technical Improvements Made
1. **Hold Timer Resilience**: BGP sessions now handle WireGuard latency variations
2. **Clean WireGuard Config**: Eliminated duplicate/misconfigured peers
3. **Proper IPv6 Configuration**: Anycast addressing corrected
4. **Looking Glass Functionality**: Web interface now properly displays BGP routes
5. **Configuration Management**: Centralized BGP config templates with proper timing

## Files Modified/Created

### Configuration Files
- `bgp_config.json` - Updated with BGP hold timers
- `working-lg.php` - Fixed BGP query syntax and company name
- `generated_configs/lax/ibgp.conf` - Deployed with updated timers
- `generated_configs/ewr/ibgp.conf` - Deployed with updated timers

### Documentation
- `BGP_MESH_WORK_SUMMARY.md` - This comprehensive summary

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Priority
1. **Resolve ORD Node**: 
   - Investigate why ORD (66.42.113.101) remains unresponsive
   - May require direct console access via Vultr dashboard
   - Deploy updated BGP configuration once accessible

2. **Complete iBGP Mesh**:
   - Verify all 3 client nodes connect to LAX route reflector
   - Validate full route propagation across mesh

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Deploy Hyperglass**: Upgrade from simple PHP looking glass to hyperglass
2. **IPv6 BGP Verification**: Ensure IPv6 routing is fully operational on all nodes
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement automated BGP session monitoring
4. **Documentation**: Create operational runbooks for future maintenance

## Security Notes

- All Vultr API keys remain in `.env` file (gitignored)
- No sensitive credentials exposed in committed code
- BGP passwords remain in secure configuration templates

## Technical Lessons Learned

1. **WireGuard + BGP Timing**: Default BGP hold timers insufficient for WireGuard tunnel latency
2. **Configuration Validation**: Duplicate WireGuard peers can cause severe routing issues
3. **API-Based Recovery**: Vultr API essential for recovering unresponsive cloud instances
4. **IPv6 Address Precision**: Exact anycast addressing critical for protocol functionality
5. **Progressive Debugging**: Systematic approach to isolating network layer issues
