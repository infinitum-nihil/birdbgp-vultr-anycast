# BGP Anycast Mesh Network Status - May 24, 2025

## Project Overview
Successfully architected and implemented a service discovery-driven, dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) BGP anycast mesh network across 4 geographic locations. The solution provides true anycast routing using announced IP addresses, enabling users to automatically connect to the closest geographic node while maintaining a scalable, multi-provider architecture.

## Network Architecture
- **ASN:** 27218 (Infinitum Nihil)
- **IPv4 Prefix:** 192.30.120.0/23 (512 IPs)
- **IPv6 Prefix:** 2620:71:4000::/48
- **WireGuard IPv4 Subnet:** 10.10.10.0/24 (mesh tunnels)
- **WireGuard IPv6 Subnet:** fd00:10:10::/48 (mesh tunnels)
- **Anycast Service IP:** 192.30.120.100 (web services + looking glass)

## Geographic IP Allocation (/29 per Region)
| Region | Subnet | Vultr Primary | Vultr Secondary | AWS Primary | GCP Primary |
|--------|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| LAX | 192.30.120.0/29 | .1 | .2 | .3 | .4 |
| ORD | 192.30.120.8/29 | .9 | .12 | .11 | .13 |
| EWR | 192.30.120.16/29 | .17 | .18 | .19 | .20 |
| MIA | 192.30.120.24/29 | .25 | .26 | .27 | .28 |

## ✅ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Service Discovery Architecture
- **Complete service discovery system** built with RESTful API
- **Geographic IP allocation strategy** with /29 subnets per region for multi-provider expansion
- **Dynamic configuration management** eliminates hardcoded configurations
- **Auto-discovery by external IP** enables self-configuring nodes
- **Centralized firewall rule distribution** ensures consistent security posture

### 2. True Anycast Implementation
- **Announced IP binding on dummy interfaces** verified as fully supported by Vultr
- **Anycast service IP (192.30.120.10)** for global load balancing to closest node
- **Regional direct access IPs** for administrative and diagnostic purposes
- **Multi-provider ready architecture** with reserved IP slots for AWS, GCP, Azure

### 3. IPv6 Dual-Stack WireGuard Mesh
- **Complete dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) WireGuard mesh** operational across all 4 locations
- **Verified IPv6 connectivity** between all nodes using fd00:10:10::/48 addressing
- **Proper private key management** through service discovery system
- **BGP hold timer optimization** (240s hold, 80s keepalive) for tunnel stability

### 4. Security Implementation
- **Minimal attack surface design** with strict firewall rules
- **Announced IPs:** Only web services (80/443) + internal mesh API (8080)
- **Vultr IPs:** Restricted to BGP peering, WireGuard mesh, and admin SSH

- **Dual-stack BGP announcements** for both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes
- **BIRD 2.17.1 installation** from source for latest features and stability

## 🔄 Current Status: Ready for Production Deployment

### Service Discovery System
- **✅ Fully Functional:** RESTful API tested and operational
- **✅ Configuration Validated:** All BIRD configs verified for correctness
- **✅ Cloud-Init Integration:** Smart bootstrap script queries service discovery
- **✅ Multi-Provider Ready:** Infrastructure scales across cloud providers

### Deployment Strategy
**Previous Approach Issues Resolved:**
- ❌ Hardcoded configurations led to errors and inconsistencies
- ❌ Wrong private keys broke WireGuard connectivity  
- ❌ BGP default route imports caused routing conflicts
- ❌ Manual configuration was error-prone and time-consuming

**New Service Discovery Approach:**
- ✅ **Dynamic configuration** from centralized source of truth
- ✅ **Verified private keys** stored securely in service discovery
- ✅ **Aggressive BGP filtering** prevents default route issues
- ✅ **Automated deployment** reduces human error significantly

## 🎯 Next Steps: Production Deployment

### Immediate (Priority: High)
1. **Deploy Service Discovery API** to production endpoint
2. **Recreate nodes with service discovery cloud-init** using verified configurations
3. **Test anycast connectivity** to 192.30.120.10 from multiple locations
4. **Verify BGP announcements** are visible in global routing tables

### Enhancement Phase (Priority: Medium)
1. **Deploy BGP looking glass** to all nodes for network diagnostics
2. **Implement geographic HTTP routing** for user-facing services
3. **Add monitoring and alerting** for BGP session health
4. **Expand to additional providers** (AWS, GCP) using existing IP allocation

### Future Expansion (Priority: Low)
1. **RPKI/ASPA compliance** for enhanced route security
2. **Additional geographic regions** (EU, APAC) with new /29 allocations
3. **DDoS protection integration** leveraging anycast architecture
4. **Performance optimization** and traffic engineering

## Key Innovations & Lessons Learned

### 1. Service Discovery Architecture
**Innovation:** Eliminated hardcoded configurations through centralized API
**Benefit:** Self-configuring nodes, consistent deployments, easy scaling

### 2. Announced IP Strategy  
**Discovery:** Vultr fully supports binding announced BGP IPs to dummy interfaces
**Implementation:** Each node binds regional IP + anycast IP for true geographic routing

### 3. Aggressive BGP Filtering
**Problem Solved:** Default routes imported via iBGP broke external connectivity
**Solution:** Strict filters allowing only our announced prefixes (192.30.120.0/23, 2620:71:4000::/48)

### 4. Multi-Provider Design
**Future-Proofing:** /29 allocations per region support 4 providers per location
**Scalability:** Can deploy identical infrastructure on AWS, GCP, Azure using same IP scheme

### 5. Security-First Approach
**Principle:** Minimal attack surface on announced IPs, strict source-based access control
**Implementation:** Web services only on announced IPs, infrastructure management on Vultr IPs
