# BGP Mesh Deployment Status - May 24, 2025 19:19:15

## Current Situation
We have 3 fresh Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instances deployed but they are sitting idle without cloud-init configuration:
- ord-bgp-fresh: 45.76.18.21 (Status: up but no BGP config)
- mia-bgp-fresh: 45.77.192.217 (Status: up but no BGP config)  
- ewr-bgp-fresh: 149.28.56.192 (Status: up but no BGP config)

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Instances were deployed without the `user_data` field containing cloud-init configuration, so they're just basic Ubuntu servers.

## Where We Came From

### Initial Context
This session continued from a previous conversation about deploying a production BGP anycast mesh with service discovery. The user had requested:
1. Repository cleanup to separate production scripts from testing tools
2. Comprehensive IP address allocation documentation  
3. Optimization of anycast IP allocation (consolidated to single IP: 192.30.120.100)
4. Mandatory IPv6 enablement on all deployments
5. Dual SSH key support for work and local access

### Key Technical Work Completed
1. **Service Discovery API**: Implemented self-registration system at http://149.248.2.74:5000
2. **IP Documentation**: Updated README.md with detailed IPv4 (192.30.120.0/23) and IPv6 (2620:71:4000::/48) allocations
3. **Anycast Optimization**: Consolidated from multiple IPs to single 192.30.120.100 serving multiple services on different ports
4. **SSH Key Management**: Added both work and local SSH keys to Vultr account
5. **Cloud-init Template**: Created self-registration capable bootstrap (cloud-init-with-service-discovery.yaml)

### Previous Deployment Issues
1. **Chicken-and-egg IP Problem**: New instances got random IPs but service discovery needed to know IPs beforehand
2. **Registration Slot Availability**: API had old IPs, causing "no available node slots for registration" errors
3. **Multiple Node Failures**: Previous deployments failed during cloud-init with registration errors

### Critical Fixes Implemented
1. **Self-Registration System**: Nodes now register themselves with the API before discovery
2. **Schema Reset**: Updated service-discovery-schema.json to reset endpoint IPs to "0.0.0.0:51820" 
3. **API Registration Endpoint**: Added `/api/v1/nodes/register` endpoint to service-discovery-api.py
4. **API Restart**: Restarted service discovery API on LAX (149.248.2.74) with corrected schema

### Recent Actions
1. **Node Destruction**: Successfully destroyed previous failed instances (ORD, MIA, EWR)
2. **Fresh Deployment**: Deployed new instances with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (OS ID: 2284)
3. **API Key Issues**: Resolved repeated API key lookup problems (OOBGITQGHOKATE5WMUYXCKE3UTA5O6OW4ENQ)

## Current Infrastructure

### Active Nodes
- **LAX (Primary)**: 149.248.2.74 - Route reflector, service discovery API host
- **ORD (Fresh)**: 45.76.18.21 - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, no BGP config yet
- **MIA (Fresh)**: 45.77.192.217 - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, no BGP config yet  
- **EWR (Fresh)**: 149.28.56.192 - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, no BGP config yet

### Service Discovery API Status
- **Location**: LAX node (149.248.2.74:5000)
- **Status**: Running with self-registration endpoint
- **Schema**: Reset to allow new node registration
- **Test**: Successfully registered test IP 192.30.120.8 as ORD node

### Network Allocation
- **IPv4 Block**: 192.30.120.0/23 (ARIN assigned)
- **IPv6 Block**: 2620:71:4000::/48 (ARIN assigned)
- **Anycast IP**: 192.30.120.100 (consolidated single IP)
- **WireGuard Mesh**: 10.10.10.0/24 tunnel network

## Where We Are Going

### Immediate Next Steps
**DECISION POINT**: Choose approach for configuring the fresh instances:

**Option A: Destroy and Redeploy with Cloud-init**
- Pros: Clean automated deployment, full cloud-init logging
- Cons: Lose time waiting for new instances to boot

**Option B: Manual Configuration of Existing Instances**  
- Pros: Keep Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instances that are already booted
- Cons: Manual process, less automated

### Required Actions (Either Path)
1. **Add SSH Keys**: Ensure both SSH keys are available on instances
2. **Execute Bootstrap**: Run cloud-init configuration manually or via redeploy
3. **Monitor Self-Registration**: Verify nodes register with service discovery API
4. **BGP Session Establishment**: Confirm iBGP mesh forms with LAX as route reflector
5. **Anycast Verification**: Test 192.30.120.100 is announced globally

### Todo Status
- [x] Destroy failed nodes with registration errors
- [x] Deploy fresh BGP nodes with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS  
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS**: Configure nodes with BGP mesh setup
- [ ] Monitor bootstrap completion and BGP establishment
- [ ] Verify mesh connectivity and anycast announcements

## Technical Context

### BGP Mesh Architecture
- **AS Number**: 27218
- **Topology**: iBGP mesh with LAX as route reflector
- **External Peering**: Vultr (AS64515) via 169.254.169.254 and 2001:19f0:ffff::1
- **Authentication**: MD5 password "xV72GUaFMSYxNmee"

### Key Files
- `service-discovery-api.py`: Self-registration capable API
- `service-discovery-schema.json`: Reset schema with 0.0.0.0 endpoints
- `cloud-init-with-service-discovery.yaml`: Bootstrap script with self-registration
- `deploy_production_mesh.sh`: Updated for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS deployment

### Most Recent Query
**User**: "its like cloudinit isnt running - did you include it?"

**Assistant Response**: "You're absolutely right - I deployed the instances without the cloud-init configuration! I created them with minimal parameters and didn't include the `user_data` field with the cloud-init script. That's why they're just sitting there as basic Ubuntu instances."

**Root Cause**: Deployed instances using minimal API calls without `user_data` field containing base64-encoded cloud-init configuration.

## Next Session Handoff
The immediate decision needed is whether to destroy and redeploy with proper cloud-init or manually configure the existing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS instances. All supporting infrastructure (service discovery API, schemas, SSH keys) is properly configured and tested.
