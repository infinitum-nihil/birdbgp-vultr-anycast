# BGP Mesh Network Configuration Summary

## Overview
We've corrected the configuration issues with the WireGuard mesh network and BGP setup, but are experiencing connectivity issues with some of the servers.

## Resolved Issues

1. **WireGuard IP Assignment**
   - All servers now have the correct WireGuard IP assignment based on geographic proximity to LA:
     - LAX (primary/route reflector): 10.10.10.1
     - ORD (secondary): 10.10.10.2 
     - MIA (tertiary): 10.10.10.3
     - EWR (quaternary): 10.10.10.4

2. **BIRD Configuration**
   - BIRD configurations have been updated on all servers
   - LAX is properly configured as the route reflector
   - All other servers are configured as iBGP clients pointing to LAX
   - **IMPORTANT**: Router IDs were incorrectly using WireGuard IPs (private IPs)
   - Router IDs should use public IPs, especially for eBGP sessions

3. **WireGuard Mesh**
   - WireGuard configurations have been corrected
   - Correct public keys and endpoints are configured
   - We observed successful connectivity between MIA and ORD

## Progress Update

1. **Router ID Configuration**
   - Router IDs have been successfully updated on LAX and EWR to use public IPs
   - Successfully verified router IDs are correctly set to public IPs on both servers
   - Router ID for ORD could not be updated as the server was unreachable

2. **Intermittent Connectivity Issues**
   - LAX was initially down, then became reachable long enough to update its router ID
   - EWR was initially down, then became reachable long enough to update its router ID
   - MIA was initially the only reachable server, but later became unreachable
   - ORD has remained unreachable throughout our troubleshooting
   - As of the last check, all servers are currently unreachable
   - This strongly indicates a provider-level networking issue at Vultr

3. **Attempted Configurations**
   - Successfully updated BIRD configuration on LAX and EWR to use public IPs as router IDs
   - Attempted to update MIA's iBGP configuration to point back to LAX
   - Configuration tasks were repeatedly interrupted by servers becoming unreachable

## Next Steps

1. **Check Vultr Control Panel**
   - Verify all servers are running in the Vultr control panel
   - Check for any provider-wide outages or maintenance notices
   - Look for any network connectivity issues reported by Vultr
   - Verify the status of the public IPs assigned to each server

2. **Attempt Server Recovery**
   - If servers appear to be running but unreachable, attempt a hard reset through the Vultr control panel
   - Check for any console output that might indicate the cause of the connectivity issues
   - Verify that the network interfaces are properly configured on each server

3. **Once Connectivity is Restored**
   - Follow the procedures in the BGP_MESH_RECOVERY.md document
   - Complete the router ID configuration on any remaining servers
   - Configure LAX as the primary route reflector
   - Verify BGP sessions between all servers

4. **Monitor Network Stability**
   - Once servers are back online, monitor the stability of the network connections
   - Check for any packet loss or latency issues that might affect BGP sessions
   - Verify that WireGuard connections are stable

5. **Implement Robustness Improvements**
   - Add redundancy to the BGP configuration (multiple route reflectors)
   - Implement automated health checks and failover procedures
   - Configure BIRD to be more resilient to network interruptions
   - Consider using floating IPs or other high-availability solutions

## Reference: WireGuard IP Assignments
- LAX (primary): 10.10.10.1
- ORD (secondary): 10.10.10.2
- MIA (tertiary): 10.10.10.3
- EWR (quaternary): 10.10.10.4
