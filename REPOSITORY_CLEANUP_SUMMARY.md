# Repository Cleanup Summary - May 24, 2025

## Overview
Successfully cleaned and organized the BGP anycast mesh repository, removing obsolete scripts and consolidating production-ready components.

## Actions Taken

### üìÅ Archive Organization
Created structured archive directories:
- `archive/legacy_deployment/` - Old deployment methods (15 scripts)
- `archive/manual_fixes/` - Manual fix scripts replaced by automation (25+ scripts)  
- `archive/testing_scripts/` - Development and testing tools (20+ scripts)
- `archive/temp_tools/` - One-time use scripts and temporary files (30+ files)
- `archive/hyperglass_backup/` - Looking glass experiments (moved from existing)

### üóëÔ∏è Files Removed/Archived
- **89 legacy shell scripts** moved to appropriate archive directories
- **Duplicate documentation files** consolidated
- **Testing configurations** (YAML, PHP, Docker configs) archived
- **Temporary files** (cursor.AppImage, system files) archived
- **Old deployment state** files archived

### ‚úÖ Production Files Retained
**Essential Scripts (Root Directory):**
- `deploy_production_mesh.sh` - Main deployment orchestration
- `manual_bootstrap.sh` - Manual node configuration utility
- `readystatuscheck.sh` - Instance readiness monitoring
- `service-discovery-api.py` - Geographic-intelligent service discovery

**Configuration Files:**
- `service-discovery-schema.json` - Node assignment schema with geographic intelligence
- `bird-ord-correct.conf` - Proven correct BIRD configuration template
- `bgp_config.json` - BGP network configuration
- `cloud-init-with-service-discovery.yaml` - Automated bootstrap template

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Updated with GOALS, TOPOLOGIES, and TECHNOLOGIES sections
- `BGP_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_FINAL.md` - Current deployment status and next steps
- `STATEMENT_OF_FACTS.md` - Critical deployment facts and credentials
- `SECURITY.md` - Security implementation guidelines
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant context and procedures

**Project Directories (Kept):**
- `config_files/` - BGP configuration management
- `diagnostic_tools/` - Production monitoring scripts
- `vm_management/` - Instance lifecycle management
- `cleanup_scripts/` - Resource cleanup utilities
- `generated_configs/` - Auto-generated node configurations

## Repository Statistics

### Before Cleanup
- **150+ scripts** scattered across root directory
- **Multiple duplicate** configurations and documentation
- **Unclear separation** between production and testing code
- **Historical scripts** mixed with current tools

### After Cleanup  
- **4 essential scripts** in root directory
- **Clear production focus** with archived historical code
- **Organized documentation** with comprehensive guides
- **Streamlined deployment** process

## Current Architecture Support

The cleaned repository now directly supports the current production architecture:

### Service Discovery Driven
- Geographic intelligence via Vultr API integration
- Self-registration for zero-touch deployment
- Automated configuration distribution

### Modern Infrastructure
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with latest security updates
- BIRD 2.17.1 with proper MD5 authentication
- WireGuard mesh with dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
- Cloud-init automation for consistent deployment

### Production Ready
- Proven configurations with no authentication errors
- Geographic routing correctly implemented
- Security hardening with UFW firewall rules
- Comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics

## Next Steps
1. Commit cleaned repository to version control
2. Complete deployment of remaining nodes (MIA, EWR)
3. Establish full iBGP mesh connectivity
4. Verify global route announcements

This cleanup provides a solid foundation for completing the BGP anycast mesh deployment with clear, maintainable code and comprehensive documentation.
