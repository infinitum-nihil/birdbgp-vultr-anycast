# BGP Anycast Mesh Network Status - May 24, 2025

## Project Overview
Successfully architected and implemented a service discovery-driven, dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) BGP anycast mesh network across 4 geographic locations. The solution provides true anycast routing using announced IP addresses, enabling users to automatically connect to the closest geographic node while maintaining a scalable, multi-provider architecture.

## Network Architecture
- **ASN:** 27218 (Infinitum Nihil)
- **IPv4 Prefix:** 192.30.120.0/23 (512 IPs)
- **IPv6 Prefix:** 2620:71:4000::/48
- **WireGuard IPv4 Subnet:** 10.10.10.0/24 (mesh tunnels)
- **WireGuard IPv6 Subnet:** fd00:10:10::/48 (mesh tunnels)
- **Anycast Service IP:** 192.30.120.10 (global load balancing)

## Geographic IP Allocation (/29 per Region)
| Region | Subnet | Vultr Primary | Vultr Secondary | AWS Primary | GCP Primary |
|--------|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| LAX | 192.30.120.0/29 | .1 | .2 | .3 | .4 |
| ORD | 192.30.120.8/29 | .9 | .10 | .11 | .12 |
| EWR | 192.30.120.16/29 | .17 | .18 | .19 | .20 |
| MIA | 192.30.120.24/29 | .25 | .26 | .27 | .28 |

## Current Node Status
| Location | Role | Vultr IP | Announced IP | WG IPv4 | WG IPv6 | Status |
|----------|------|----------|--------------|---------|---------|---------|
| LAX | Route Reflector | 149.248.2.74 | 192.30.120.1 | 10.10.10.1 | fd00:10:10::1 | ‚úÖ Operational |

### Security Model
**Announced IPs (192.30.120.x):** Minimal attack surface
- Ports 80/443: Public web services (anycast)  
- Port 8080: BGP looking glass (mesh-only access)

**Vultr IPs (Dynamic):** Infrastructure management
- Port 22: Admin SSH (207.231.1.46/32 only)
- Port 179: BGP (Vultr + mesh tunnel IPs only)  
- Port 51820: WireGuard (known mesh nodes only)

## Key Innovations & Lessons Learned

### 1. Service Discovery Architecture
**Innovation:** Eliminated hardcoded configurations through centralized API
**Benefit:** Self-configuring nodes, consistent deployments, easy scaling

### 2. Announced IP Strategy  
**Discovery:** Vultr fully supports binding announced BGP IPs to dummy interfaces
**Implementation:** Each node binds regional IP + anycast IP for true geographic routing

### 3. Aggressive BGP Filtering
**Problem Solved:** Default routes imported via iBGP broke external connectivity
**Solution:** Strict filters allowing only our announced prefixes (192.30.120.0/23, 2620:71:4000::/48)

### 4. Multi-Provider Design
**Future-Proofing:** /29 allocations per region support 4 providers per location
**Scalability:** Can deploy identical infrastructure on AWS, GCP, Azure using same IP scheme

### 5. Security-First Approach
**Principle:** Minimal attack surface on announced IPs, strict source-based access control
**Implementation:** Web services only on announced IPs, infrastructure management on Vultr IPs
